A practical algorithm needs to determine whether a document is a duplicate of another in a document corpus in real-time.In this report, a vector model approach is used to detect near duplicate text documents on Hadoop MapReduce. Documents are considered duplicates if their similarity measure is greater than a given threshold value. The approach was tested on a corpus of 200 text documents and result shows the approach is accurate.
The algorithm makes use of a prefix and length filter in order to avoid computing all possible pairs of documents in the corpus.The length filter has the property that |P| ≥ t x |Q|(tє[0,1]) where |P| is the length of document P, and |Q| length of document Q with |Q| > |P|. The prefix filter has a property that two documents must have at least one common prefix if their similarity is not lesser than a given threshold. For document P, the prefix length is defined as prefixlength = |P| - [t x |P|] +1.

A practical algorithm will need to determine whether a document is a duplicate of another in a collection of documents in real-time.A novel vector based  approach was used to detect near duplicate in text documents on Hadoop MapReduce.  Documents are considered duplicates if their similarity measure is greater than a given threshold value. 
The algorithm used a prefix and length filter in order to avoid computing all possible pairs of documents in the collections. Prefix and length filter was used so as not to compute all the possible pairs of records in the documents collection. The length filter has the property that |P| ≥ t X|Q|(tє[0,1]) where |P| is the length of document P, and |Q| length of document Q with |Q| > |P|. The prefix filter has a property that two documents must have at least one common prefix if their similarity is not lesser than a given threshold. For document P, the prefix length is defined as prefixlength = |P| - [t x |P|] +1. The approach was tested on a collection of 5000 documents. Near duplicates can be reliably detected through this similarity measure.
